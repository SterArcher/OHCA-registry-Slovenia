# See you in Glasgow 2022

We will be attending [EMS 2022 congress in Glasgow](https://emseurope.org). Our members Rok Miklič and Luka Petravić will be going there to present our idea and find new international contacts.

# Thank you!

We would like to thank Faculty of Medicine, University of Maribor for funding our trip and congress organisers for making it possible for us to come - especially Freddy Lipert.

# See you there!
