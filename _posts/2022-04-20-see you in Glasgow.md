We will be attending [EMS 2022 congress in Glasgow](https://emseurope.org). Our members Rok Miklič and Luka Petravić will be going there to present our idea and find new international contacts. Our members will be there a day before the official start of the EMS 2022 to attend the [Global Resusciation Alliance](https://www.globalresuscitationalliance.org) Update Meetin 2022. We are honoured to be invited to participate in their meeting.

## Thank you!

We would like to thank Faculty of Medicine, University of Maribor for funding our trip and congress organisers for making it possible for us to come - especially Freddy Lipert.

## See you there!
