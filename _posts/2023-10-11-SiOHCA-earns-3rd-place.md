SiOHCA, one of 39 projects under PD≈† UM 2022/2023, has clinched the 3rd place at the final event. This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the unwavering support of our mentors, partners, and a fantastic network of supporters.

A heartfelt Thank You goes to our mentors, partners, the university and all the other people who selflessly helped us by consulting, networking or otherwise. 

SiOHCA's success is a testament to the power of teamwork and shared vision. Our diverse skills and collective effort set us apart from the competition.

This award is a milestone, not the finish line. SiOHCA remains open-source and ready for further innovation and research. We‚Äôre hopeful and excited about the future of the project.
