A part of the SioHCA team attended the 29th International Symposium on Emergency Medicine organized by SZUM in beautiful Portoro≈æ.

We extend our sincere gratitude to the symposium organizers for enabling our participation and to the Medical Faculty University of Maribor for their support. Their generosity allowed us to engage fully in the symposium and contribute to the discussions on emergency medicine.

Our lecture, [Introduction to the SiOHCA Registry: from idea to pilot implementation (click)](https://zenodo.org/record/8042140), resonated with the audience. The attendees showed genuine interest, and we appreciated their active engagement. The positive response affirmed the significance of SiOHCA's innovative approach to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest data collection.

We were overwhelmed by the positive feedback received after our lecture. The discussion further highlighted the relevance of SiOHCA's work. We are grateful for the encouragement and support we received, as it motivates us to continue our mission of building a cardiac arrest registry.

As a token of appreciation, we provided attendees with  SiOHCA t-shirts. This gesture allowed us to express our gratitude and raise awareness about SiOHCA among symposium participants.

Alongside the engaging academic lessons and workshops, we were delighted by the delectable cuisine. Furthermore, the symposium's social event was a memorable evening, highlighted by an enthralling performance by Nina Pu≈°lar. The lively atmosphere and the opportunity to unwind and connect with fellow professionals added an extra layer of enjoyment to the event. Additionally, the breathtaking seaside views of Portoro≈æ served as a picturesque backdrop, reminding us of the beauty and serenity that can be found along the Adriatic coast.
