>> It was really amazing to meet the key members of the GRA and show our open-source cardiac registry software. I am humbled by the people who I got to sit with and listen to their expertise. I would also like to thank everyone for being kind to both of us newcomers.

### The dinner
Later in the evening we attended a very memorable dinner, that took place at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (see the picture bellow).

We met a lot of very interesting people and learned useful new information. It was the greatest honour to talk with [Douglas Anthony Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Chamberlain). He is the person who began with paramedic service in Europe, devloped the basic 10 rules of an normal ECG, was one of the first authors to describe beta blockers, he determined that atropine could cause the vagal blockage, he was first to use AEDs in Europe and many more. You could read more about his achievements in the [ERC document](https://cms.erc.edu/sites/5714e77d5e615861f00f7d18/content_entry574dadbd5e6158358f5cf96b/574dae635e6158358f5cfa93/files/Douglas_Chamberlain.pdf?1489672640).

>> The dinner was a wonderful surprise. I was inspired by all the people I met and exchanged thoughts with and humbled by the magnificence of the Royal College. The musical performance was a great addition to the incredibly rich and flavoursome dishes.

The food and the service was exceptional. We really could not wish for a better entertainment. The songs were beautiful.
