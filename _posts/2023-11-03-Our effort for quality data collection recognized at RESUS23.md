Barcelona is currently hosting the European Resuscitation Council's (ERC) annual congress, #RESUS23. The congress is as a vital platform for discussing the latest advancements in resuscitation and emergency medicine. Our menotr, professor Matej Strnad, attended the event.
 
RESUS23 is a networking opportunity for the EuReCa 3 members. The EuReCa 3 network praised our country for providing high-quality data right from the start, minimizing the need for data adjustments and refinements.

This achievement showcases the value of digitalized data collection and our commitment to building a motivated community. We extend our gratitude to all contributors who put in the effort to make quality data collection possible. 

As we look forward to the publication of the EuReCa 3 study results in 2024, we can take pride in our country's contribution to improving emergency medical care on an international scale.
