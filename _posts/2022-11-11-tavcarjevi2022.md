SiOHCA is always working to convey our work to the medical community, which is also our primary demographic right now. We are firm believers that you can only improve what you measure. A small portion of our work includes determining and improving the situation of medical digitalization in Slovenia.

We presented our [poster (everything we do is open-access)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7305556) about the digitalization of emergency medicine services in our country.

The general atmosphere of the incredibly lively meeting was extremely inviting and enlightening. We created a lot of new connections and spread the word about the impending tsunami of digitization that our healthcare sector desperately needs and desires.

We would like to thank all of the congress attendees for their inquiries about our research, Eva Zupan Horaček for creating the poster, and all of the SiOHCA members for their hard work.
