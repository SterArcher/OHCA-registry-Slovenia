As Luka and Rok have arrived safely to the local airport we would like to thank everyone whose paths have crossed with ours. Firstly, we would like to thank our team who stayed at home and kept our platform working. Everything we do is a team effort, without our colleagues we are nothing (students Evgenija Burger, Eva Poljan코ek, Ur코a Ke코e, Domen Kulovec, Ga코per Tom코i캜, Ga코per 말rcelj and mentors Miha Brezovnik & Matej Strnad).

**Freddy Lippert**, who invited us to the congress and connected us with his friends from around the globe. It would be impossible for us to come to an event like this, if not for him.

**Ann Doll**, who made it a reality for us to participate in the GRA meeting. We were humbled by the knowledge that surrounded us.

There are many more, actually much more, than we can write in a post. We hope to have made good impressions and are looking forward to all of the projects we might embark upon **together**.

This trip would have not been possible without the help of our Faculty of medicine, University of Maribor and kind employees.

We hope to see all of our new friends soon!
