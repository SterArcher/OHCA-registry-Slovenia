At SiOHCA we are committed to constantly making the platform better, more user friendly, more secure, and more useful. We believe in mutually beneficial collaboration and sharing our work, knowledge, and data. This week we visited [Better Care](https://better.care/) at their headquarters in Ljubljana to learn more about their work and to talk about future collaboration possibilities. 

Better Care is one of the leading digital health companies that connects more than 1000 healthcare institutions across 16 different markets on 4 continents. 

SiOHCA and Better Care share many of the same values. Both of our solutions are open and modular. We believe in open science and deliver digital solutions that make patient care, medical research, and data storage user friendly and secure. 

The Better Care platform is scalable, truly interoperable, and no-code based for user. By using the [openEHR data standard](https://openehr.org/) they are making sure the data is not dependent on their app and can be securely used by any other third-party apps a client might need. As we want to future-proof our platform this is definitely something we will try to implement.

Their database includes multiple healthcare registers. We are excited to think about the potential of our data if it would be connected and matched with other sources as well. One single app serving as a backbone for multiple registries, data formats, and data sources seems to be the optimal solution for healthcare data management. It could make clinical decisions easier, research better, and AI smarter.

Better Care ML algorithms transform free text into structured data points, which is one of the features we were most excited about. Transforming medical documentation into a machine-readable format has the power to generate a database with endless possibilities.

We are especially thankful to the founder and CEO, Tomaž Gornik, that kindly welcomed us into the company, inspired us, offered advice, and expressed interest to provide us mentorship and guidance when our next grant gets approved. We believe this collaboration could take our platform to a completely new level.
