We are thrilled to announce that our SiOHCA out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry is going *live*. The project weâ€™ve been working on for months is ready to ingest real-world data and, hopefully, contribute to the improvement of science, medical guidelines, and, most importantly, cardiac arrest survival both at home and abroad.

Starting September 1st we will be supporting the Slovenian part of data gathering for the EuReCa THREE study - [click to read more](https://siohca.um.si/posts/EuReCa-3-and-SiOHCA).

We will be covering a population of 1,398,357 people, which is **66 % of all residents** in Slovenia and collecting data from 110 (**52 %** of total) Slovenian municipalities as shown on the map below.

We have built a strong, secure, and user-friendly platform for data gathering and we are excited to improve it as new challenges arise during the study.

To make things user-friendly in a under-digitalized system we designed printable forms that are identical to our digital forms. That will enable the participants to comfortably fill in the forms as they are used to and easily transfer the data to our digital database later. Additionally, it will encourage them to make a gentle switch to digital interfaces once our project moves closer to the national cardiac arrest registry.

Several data points will be transferred directly from the dispatch center to make filling out the forms faster.
To all the participants, partners, and mentors - thank you for your trust and selfless contribution to the EuReCa THREE study and the SiOHCA registry.
