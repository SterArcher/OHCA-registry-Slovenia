We are thrilled to announce that we have been awarded a grant from the University of Maribor.

This means we can begin development on version 2.0 and employ two more team members. We are delighted to get the assistance we require and look forward to working with our mentor, TomaÅ¾ Gornik with [Better care company](http://better.care/webinar/openehr-bringing-theory-to-life/).

We are currently actively working on finding the right 2 developers for our team and have already added a law student to our interdisciplinary assembly. 

We will be updating you as the project develops. Right now we can only say that we have big plans for the future.
