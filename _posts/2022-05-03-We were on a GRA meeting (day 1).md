The GRA covered different topics on how to improve different aspects of cardiac arrest care. Including big data, resucitation academy, contribution of technology and many many more...

> It was really amazing to meet the key members of the GRA and show our open-source cardiac registry software. I am humbled by the people who I got to sit with and listen to their expertise. I would also like to thank everyone for being kind to both of us newcomers.

We were also very happy to get to know Sattha Riyapan from Bagkok, Thailand. 
  
We hope that we will be able to build on these relationships throught the week and bring new knowledge and connections back to Maribor.

### The dinner
Later in the evening we attended a very memorable dinner, that took place at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.

We met a lot of very interesting people and learned useful new information. It was the greatest honour to talk with [Douglas Anthony Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Chamberlain). He is the person who began with paramedic service in Europe, devloped the basic 10 rules of an normal ECG, was one of the first authors to describe beta blockers, he determined that atropine could cause the vagal blockage, he was first to use AEDs in Europe and so much more. You could read more about his achievements in the [ERC document](https://cms.erc.edu/sites/5714e77d5e615861f00f7d18/content_entry574dadbd5e6158358f5cf96b/574dae635e6158358f5cfa93/files/Douglas_Chamberlain.pdf?1489672640).

>The dinner was a wonderful surprise. I was inspired by all the people I met and exchanged thoughts with and humbled by the magnificence of the Royal College. The musical performance was a great addition to the incredibly rich and flavoursome dishes.

The food and the service was exceptional. We really could not wish for a better entertainment. The songs were beautiful. 

We were also really impressed with the book collection. Some books are dated back even to the 15th century.

We would like to thank our hosts Ann Doll and Freddy Lippert for inviting us to this superb experience! We are also thanking our [Faculty of Medicine](https://www.mf.um.si/si/) for making this possible.
