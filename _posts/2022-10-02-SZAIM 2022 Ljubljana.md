# Presentation

We were fortunate enough to get accepted. We strongly believe in our cause of bringing an OHCA registry to Slovenia. It is very important to let the professionals of the fields related to it know that this initiative exists and gather. As a patient passes through a lot of hands in his clinical path, we want to address them all. Anaesthesiology certainly is one of the important specialties in this care.

We held one of the presentation with the highest number of listeners, which is humbling and also brings us big hopes for SiOHCA becoming a standard in Slovenian healthcare. 

Our poster can be accessed through our bibliography entry bellow. Our goal is to make everything we do open-access and easily accessible, bringing FAIR principles and open science to the forefront of our endeavour.
