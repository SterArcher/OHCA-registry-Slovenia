### Labs
We attended multiple EMS labs where we tested our skills on tactical EMS in a civilian setting, learned more about critical pre-hospital interventions in military and listened to an interesting discussion about the future of community paramedicine. We liked that the Labs were organised in small groups which enabled the audience to be more engaged and get some hands-on experience.

### Exhibitions
On our last day we spent quite some time going around the exhibitions we haven’t had a chance to visit during the last few days and the ones we wanted to visit again. We were inspired by [Corti’s groundbreaking AI](https://www.corti.ai) technology which further motivates us to work on a registry that could empower AI to further improve patient care and clinical outcomes. We connected with manufacturers of vital signs monitors to try to find a solution that would enable us to merge digital data from different manufacturers and formats. It’s only fair to mention ZOLL at this point as well - they have been providing us with free coffee and delicious cookies all week and we do not know how we would have survived without them.

### Friends who helped us to get started
It was quite unimaginable for us that we would ever be travelling internationally for our project. What started as a small local project quickly became a big idea. The [# of the congress was “people make EMS”](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EMS2022?src=hashtag_click) and people made all of this happen. We are really thankful for our first introduction to Ingvild Tjelmeland and Siobhan Masterson. When we were thinking about how to start this big undertaking they were kind enough to take time out of their busy schedules and show us how it is done. They offered us great guidance.

They have introduced us to Freddy Lippert.

Freddy took us in and introduced us, not only to his team, but the international network of different experts. Without him, we would have never come to Glasgow, we would not have shown our idea, got feedback, be inspired and the project would have never evolved, as it did now. Words cannot express how thankful we are for his kidness and openness.

> People make the science and without a team and a good network, you parish.

We are only sorry that we could not meet more of the world's experts as the congress agenda was packed with interesting events.

### Closing ceremony
At the closing ceremony it was announced that the Austrian team won the EMS Championship (as was Luka's bet 💪), Caroline Gren won an award for her study on video triage of children and presented her work. We think that this kind of innovation has a place in Slovenia also. We face same problems with lack of primary doctors all around the world and only EBM will help us overcome this great obstacle and improve patient care.
