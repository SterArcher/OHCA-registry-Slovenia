Last week, Rok Miklič from the SiOHCA project had the opportunity to visit the PODIM 2023 conference in Maribor, one of the most influential startup events in Europe.

We were thrilled to learn about various financing options that we didn't know before. We also got a lot of valuable insights from experts and mentors on how to optimise our business operations and scale our product.

One of the highlights of the conference was meeting other innovative entrepreneurs and hearing their stories and feedback. We got some new ideas for improving our product and making it more user-friendly. We also made some great connections that could lead to future collaborations.

Overall, it was an inspiring event that motivates us to work harder and smarter on our product. We are grateful for this opportunity and we look forward to applying what we learned to our project. Thank you for your support!
