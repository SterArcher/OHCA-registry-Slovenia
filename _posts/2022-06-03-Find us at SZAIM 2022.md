We are happy to announce that we will be taking part in [8th Slovenian congress of Anaesthesiologists 2022](https://2022.szaim.org) organised by Slovenian society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive medicine [(SZAIM)](https://szaim.org). The congress will take place between 30.9.2022 and 2.10.2022 at Four points by Sheraton in Ljubljana.

Our plan is to present the SiOHCA project and maybe even show preliminary data gathered by that time. Our simple user interface allows us to create data reports with stunning visuals on the go, without the need for any advanced IT knowledge, making it the perfect tool to show up to date information in our presentation. Eva PoljanÅ¡ek, Domen Kulovec and Luka PetraviÄ‡ will be there to answer your questions and tell you all about SiOHCA.

We would like to extend our gratitude to the organisation committee allowing us last-minute to participate. Especially assist. prof. Marko ZdravkoviÄ‡ who made us aware of the event and helped us with logistics.

>Come find us and find out more about what is it that we do.
