On March 10th, 2023 we had the privilege of attending the POPRI competition at Tehnolo≈°ki Park Ljubljana. We are proud to have been selected as one of the best projects that had an opportunity to compete at the preliminary selection.

The competition was a platform for young entrepreneurs and innovators to showcase their ideas and projects, and we were excited to be a part of it. We refined the business case pitch and Rok and Luka presented our project to the judges.

The atmosphere was inspiring, with a diverse selection of participants eager to showcase their innovations. We took the opportunity to meet other participants, network with the judges and made several connection we hope will help us with the project going forward.

Although we didn't win, we left the competition feeling inspired and motivated. We had met many passionate and talented individuals who were working hard to make a difference in the world. It was an honor to be part of such a community, and we were grateful for the opportunity to showcase our project.

We thank the judges and other attendees for the valuable feedback they provided us to improve both our product and our business model. We would like to extend our thanks to the organizers of the POPRI competition for putting together the event.

In conclusion, attending the POPRI competition was a fun experience. It was an opportunity for us to learn from other innovators and share our project with a wider audience. In addition to that, it was a great way to practice and improve our pitching abilities.
