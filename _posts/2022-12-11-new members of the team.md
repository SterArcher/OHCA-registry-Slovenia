As the Siohca project continues to grow and evolve, we are excited to welcome three new team members to our ranks.

First, we have Ema, a law student who brings a unique perspective and set of skills to the team. With her background in legal studies, Ema will be a valuable asset as we navigate the complex landscape of regulations and compliance in the tech industry.

Next, we have Tilen and Miguel, two developers who have joined the team to help us continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with our cutting-edge technology. With their expertise in a range of programming languages and frameworks, Tilen and Miguel will be instrumental in driving the Siohca project forward.

We are thrilled to have Ema, Tilen, and Miguel on board, and we are confident that their contributions will help us continue delivering innovative solutions to our clients and partners. We look forward to seeing what we can accomplish together.
