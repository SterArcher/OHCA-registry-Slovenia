On Thursday, July 16th 2022, Ur≈°a Ke≈°e attended [SZUM 2022](https://www.szum.si/simpozij-urgentne-medicine.html) congress in Grand Hotel Bernardin, Portoro≈æ to present our project and the work we have done over the last few months.

Due to some traffic restrictions we sadly arrived a bit late and could attend the lectures and workshops. Luckily, we were fortunate enough to see the last lecture segment about A&Es in Slovenia. Presenters from Ljubljana, Maribor and Izola A&E explained the system and work organisation in the facilities which was very interesting and insightful. Besides expanding her horizons by the wonderful keynotes, Ur≈°a got a first hand view of the current state of the emergency care system in Slovenia and a new insight into how SiOHCA could help.

After the main lectures followed open topics segment, where I presented our conference paper **‚ÄúThe need for an OHCA registry in Slovenia"**, authored by *Luka Petraviƒá, Evgenija Burger, Ur≈°a Ke≈°e, Domen Kulovec, Eva Poljan≈°ek, Ga≈°per ≈†ircelj, Ga≈°per Tom≈°iƒç, Miha Brezovnik and Matej Strnad*.

> It was great to see the positive response from the audience and I feel honoured that we could share our work and see it be appreciated. I also had the opportunity to meet prim. Marko Zelinka and thank him for giving us this opportunity and supporting our project.
