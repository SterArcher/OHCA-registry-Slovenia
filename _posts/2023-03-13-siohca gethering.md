On Monday, the 14th of March, we organized a get-together to celebrate the 1-year anniversary of the SiOHCA project.

The event began at the Medical Faculty of the University of Maribor where we had an opportunity to reflect on the progress we have made so far and discuss our plans for the future. We discussed the current state of the project and talked about the next steps we need to take to achieve our goals.

After the meeting, we had a tour of the simulation center at the faculty, where we got to see some of the advanced technologies and simulators used in medical training. It was fascinating to see how these technologies are used to teach medical students and how they can help us put theory into practice.

We also had a studio studio photoshoot where we took portraits for our soon-to-come redesigned website.

Later in the day, we visited the dispatcher center where Miha Brezovnik gave us a tour of their headquarters and a presentation of the dispatch system in Slovenia. We learned about how emergency calls are handled, and it was impressive to see the technology and infrastructure involved in responding to emergencies. We also had an opportunity to discuss our partnership with them.

In the evening, we had dinner at the Poper restaurant  in Maribor, where we had a chance to relax and socialize. It was a great opportunity to strengthen our relationships as a team.

Overall, the get-together was a great success. We exchanged ideas, learned new things, and were inspired to further improve the OHCA registry in Slovenia. We look forward to seeing what the future holds for our project and can't wait to celebrate more milestones in the years to come.
