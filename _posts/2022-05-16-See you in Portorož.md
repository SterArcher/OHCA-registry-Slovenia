The presentation title is **THE NEED FOR AN OHCA REGISTRY IN SLOVENIA**. We will delve into the details of what improvements were seen around the globe after introducing an OHCA national registries and why this would be a good thing to have in Slovenia.

We would like to **thank** the *organising committee* for enabling us to take part and allow us to present our short oral presentation!

We hope to see you there! üåä
