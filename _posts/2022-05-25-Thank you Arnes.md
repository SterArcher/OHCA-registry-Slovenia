[The Academic and Research Network of Slovenia (ARNES)](http://www.arnes.si/about-arnes/) is a public institute that provides network services to research, educational and cultural organisations, and enables them to establish connections and cooperation with each other and with related organisations abroad.

Today we are happy to announce that ARNES decided to support us!

Our project strives for the highest standards of good practice, and backup is definitely one of the pillars in data management. With [Arnes Shramba](http://www.arnes.si/predstavljamo-vam-prenovljeno-arnes-shrambo/), we will be able to further protect our data from loss.

The team would like to extend our gratitude to everyone who made it possible for us to get this service. Both in ARNES and Medical Faculty, University of Maribor.

Thank you!
