On the 23rd of February 2023, SiOHCA team attended the Digital Health conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia. As a project in the digital health space, we attend such conferences to network, find inspiration, and improve our project. The conference was a gathering of some of the best minds in the industry, and we came away with a wealth of knowledge and insights.

One of the most exciting things we discovered was the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve patient healthcare. As a company focused on improving cardiac arrest survival rates, we were particularly interested in how AI could help in this area.

One company that impressed us was Siemens, which showcased its AI tools for radiographic evaluations. These tools can analyze radiographic images and help provide more accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations. This has the potential to save time and improve patient care.

Another company that was inspiring is our partner Better, which developed natural language processing and decision support tools. Their tools can help doctors and nurses quickly analyze patient data and make better treatment decisions.

We also learned about the concept of apps on prescription and at-home testing, which are not yet widely available in Slovenia. However, we believe that these are steps in the right direction towards more personalized healthcare. By providing patients with the tools they need to monitor their health from home, we can catch potential health issues early on and provide more targeted treatment recommendations.

We learned about new technologies and tools that have the potential to revolutionize patient healthcare, but we also found out about how to approach different funding options that could help us bring our idea to sustainability. We are excited about the future of digital health and look forward to continuing to innovate in this space.
