### TED talks
In the morning we attended a session with 8 TED-like talks. We were excited to hear some innovative ideas on AI, psychology of citizens in emergencies, end of life, paediatric population, gravity assisted CPR, IT abuse in clinical and domestic environments and first responders in the developing world. A condensed format of lectures with unconditional or even controversial topics sparked a lot of conversations between us.

### Sessions on cardiac registries
We attended a lecture on European Cardiac Arrest Registry given by Brian McNally from Cares, Marcus Ong from the PAROS Registry and Jan-Thorsten Gräsner from EuReCa. Freddy Lippert summed it up with a talk on Future International Collaboration.  The collaboration sparked a conversation regarding the importance of international collaboration versus focusing on local improvements.

> Rubbish in, rubbish out!

### Meeting the CARES team
Today we had opportunity to talk with Kimberly Vellano from the [CARES registry, USA](https://mycares.net). We were very happy to get some time to demo our project to the people that are real legends of the field and are setting an example of how OHCA registries should work and what can be achieved with the data gathered.

We were also very fortunate to have a quick chat with Bryan McNally, who is the executive director of CARES.

> Inputing the data is boring, but the results in the end are all well worth it.

You can read on some of the amazing research published on their [website](https://mycares.net/sitepages/publicationslist.jsp).

### EMS championship
Today were also the finals of the EMS championship There were 16 teams coming from all over the world competing till we got 3 finalists (Netherlands, Austria and Lithuania) . The simulation was really impressive and looked quite immersive - it even snowed! The scenario was a [ski lift accident that happened in Gudauri, Georgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwsuBkrcMLE). There were multiple actors that teams had to give care to. The crowd in the theatre today could really appreciate all the knowledge and experience of the teams competing.

In-between teams were also very interesting keynotes. One about debriefing after hard cases, with a very important take away message:
> Rule 1 is: Don't be a d***!

The second keynote was on crush syndrome, which gave us an important refresher course on how to treat this rare, but life-threatening condition.

### Scottish traditional dinner
We had a traditional Scottish dinner experience in the old industrial restaurant right under the Central station.

We really enjoyed all of the talks we had with different people from all around the world. It was fun to try ourselves in traditional dances listening-to the band with a fiddle. There also street food served, like fish and chips.
