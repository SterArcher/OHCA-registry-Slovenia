SiOHCA survived it first project/idea pitch competition at the Digital Innovation Challenge in Maribor organised by EDIH DIGI-SI and AI REGIO. It was an amazing experience and the team a great time throughout the event.

One of the highlights of the event was the pitch competition, where teams had the opportunity to present their innovative ideas to a panel of judges. SiOHCA narrowly missed out on the first place, but we are still proud of our accomplishment and the effort we put into our content, product and project.

We would like to give a special thanks to Lise-Ann Sheahan and Aida Kamisalic Latific, the judges for the pitch competition, for telling us how to elevate our project to new heights, as well as Sarah Vidmar from the organising committee, for making this event possible.

Overall, the Digital Innovation Challenge in Maribor was a fantastic opportunity to learn, network, and showcase our skills.
