# OHCA registry Slovenia - pilot project


## About
This is an interdisciplinary student project. It is run by University of Maribor Faculty of medicine. Our goal is to develop an open-source software to help track and analyse OHCA.

## OHCA
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) describes the loss of mechanical cardiac function and the absence of systemic circulation. Time is crucial, with a lack of perfusion leading to continual cell death; with each second that passes the possibility of a good outcome decreases. Despite a long history of trying to improve how we manage OHCA, survival remains dismally low. Only over the past 5 years have clinicians begun to see meaningful improvements in prognosis and neurological outcomes. Globally, it is estimated that on average, less than 10% of all patients with OHCA will survive.
