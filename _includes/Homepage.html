        <p>This is an interdisciplinary student project. It is run by University of Maribor Faculty of medicine. Our
            goal is to develop an open-source software to help track and analyse OHCA.</p>

        <h2 id="ohca">OHCA</h2>

        <p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) describes the loss of mechanical cardiac function and the absence of
            systemic circulation. Time is crucial, with a lack of perfusion leading to continual cell death; with each
            second that passes the possibility
            of a good outcome decreases. Despite a long history of trying to improve how we manage OHCA, survival
            remains dismally low. Only over the past 5 years have clinicians begun to see meaningful improvements in
            prognosis and neurological outcomes.
            Globally, it is estimated that on average, less than 10% of all patients with OHCA will survive. </p>

        <p>The Utstein Style is a set of guidelines for uniform reporting of cardiac arrest. The Utstein Style was first
            proposed for emergency medical services in 1991. The name derives from a 1990 conference of the European
            Society of Cardiology, the European
            Academy of Anesthesiology, the European Society for Intensive Care Medicine, and related national societies,
            held at the Utstein Abbey on the island of Mosterøy, Norway.</p>
